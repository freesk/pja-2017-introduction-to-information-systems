USER MANUAL

INDEX
This is the main form that provides access to almost all forms. 
There is a variety of buttons that will generate reports and tables 
which stand for tracking.

NEW ORDER
To create a new order press a button "NEW ORDER" which can be found on the main form.
Enter some text for description (not required) then enter a price (required).
The next step is to select a property from the list of available properties.
If you can not find a property you are looking for, you should create a new one by
click on a button which is right under the list. The following actions for selecting
a customer are pretty much the same as for selecting a property.

ORDERS
This form contains a list of all orders. If you need to update details of
a particular order, this is the only right place to start from. Select an order
from the list and then click on "DELETE SELECTED" to delete it or "DETAILS" to
update or review that order. You can also create a new order from this form.
The "DELETE" button does not actually delete anything but marks the record as
"archived" so you always can restore it.

ORDER DETAILS
This form stands for editing information of orders and apart from that
a very important feature which is adding tasks. Each task can be assigned to an employee
and it has a description and a due date. Only one employee can be assigned at a time.
You can create new tasks, edit or delete them from the form "ORDER DETAILS" by
clicking on buttons at the left under the list of tasks. This form has a read-only
fields, such as: ID; Date; Client; Address. That data can not be modified due to
security reasons. If you have made a mistake during creating a new order, you have to
delete the incorrect one and create a new one. Once you have finished editing you have to
click the "SUBMIT" button.

EMPLOYEES/CUSTOMERS/PROPERTIES
Those forms and their subforms are very similar to the form "ORDERS" and its details
subform. Every record can be modified by clicking the "DETAILS" buttons while only the
"EMPLOYEES" form provides deleting functionality.

NEW INVOICE
This form can be accessed through "CLIENTS" => button "NEW INVOICE". It stands for creating
invoices. You can create an invoice only for closed orders (to close an order, open
its details and change its status to "closed"). If you already have closed
orders available you can generate a new invoice. You can specify the time range by
entering a date into the field "Since". This field will make the database return only
those records which have been registered after the entered date.

NEW CUSTOMER/NEW EMPLOYEE/NEW PROPERTY
Those forms are quite intuitive. Just fill the fields and press the "SUBMIT" buttons
to save data.
